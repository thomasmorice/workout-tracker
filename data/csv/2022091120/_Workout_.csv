A. On the HS walk make sure to extend the shoulders long before starting to walk. Shoulder taps is a good option to walking for building up strength. Split snatches is a very complex movement which creates a very good foundation for other movements. Getting strong and efficient in this one tranfers to regular snatches, lunge movements, general core stability etc.

B. Intense met-con leaning a little bit more towards the upperbody. Probably break up the Hspu/Pike and CTB/Pullup variation from the start

A. Build up to a heavy set where you test your absolute strength. Choose between 5RM, 3RM or 1RM on both movements. In Wondr `My results´ take a note of wich weight/band you used and RM/how many reps you did. 

B. Long aerobic workout with classic CF movements. Find your own pace and stay consistent. Burpees will be important to pace according to capacity. If your goal is to hit a personal best on some of the classic benchmarks later on this week back off on the intensity on both parts. The variation with One arm DB snatches is harder then the KB variation but a very good option if you want to include some more skill and unilateral work.
